This is a repo of my (teeny) mod stuff for Book of Hours. 
So it falls under their Sixth History License, i.e.:

1) It's unofficial
2) It's not affiliated or endorsed or anything of that nature 

That's pretty much it (and the Sixth History logo) since this is just small mods without assets or monetization.
